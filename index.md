# About

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Bioengineering and Robotics at Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), advised by Nikos Tsagarakis as part of the Humanoids and Human Centered Mechatronics (HHCM) Lab. My research interests lie in robot learning, embodied AI and humanoid robots. More specifically, I'm focusing on autonomous loco-manipulation of humanoid robots, integrating foundation models into robotic tasks and improving autonomy through learning.

Previously, I was a Master's student in Robotics and a student researcher at LIRMM, CNRS. I received my B.A. in Robotics Union Academy Guangdong- HongKong at GDUT and HKUST.
